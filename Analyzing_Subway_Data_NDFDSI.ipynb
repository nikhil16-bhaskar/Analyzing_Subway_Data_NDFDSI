Part of the information available are data from the subway turnstiles, containing weekly logs for cumulative entries and exits by turnstile and by subway station during a provided timeframe.\n",

    "\n",
    "For this project, you will apply the knowledge acquired in the first month of this course. We will practice basic data acquisition and data cleaning tasks to find out fundamental stuff about the data using what we learned in the Statistics course. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between data from the NYC Subway turnstiles and the city weather. For this, besides data from the subway, we will also need data from the weather in NYC. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main points that will be considered in this work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gathering data from the Internet\n",
    "- Using Statistics for Data Analysis\n",
    "- Data handling and simple graphics creation with `Pandas`\n",

    "- Remember you can see, in the left side of a code cell, when was the last time it ran, if there is a number inside the keys.\n",
    "- When starting a new session in the notebook, please make sure to run all cells up to the point where you last left it. Even if the output can still be viewed from the moment you ran your cells in the previews session, the kernel starts in a new state, so you will need to reload all data, etc. in a new session.\n",
    "- The previous point is useful to have in mind if your answers do not match what is expected from the quizzes in the classroom. Try reloading the data and running all processing steps, one by one, to make sure you're working with the same variables and data from each step of the quizz."

    "Let's do it!! Now it's your turn to gather data. Please write bellow a Python code to access the link http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html and download all files from June 2017. The file must be named turnstile_100617.txt, where 10/06/17 is the file's date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see below a few commands that might help you:\n",

    "Use the **urllib** library to open and redeem a webpage. Use the command below, where **url** is the webpage path to the following file:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "u = urllib.urlopen(url)\n",
    "html = u.read()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the **BeautifulSoup** library to search for the link to the file you want to donwload in the page. Use the command below to create your *soup* object and search for all 'a' tags in the document:\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "soup = BeautifulSoup(html, \"html.parser\")\n",
    "links = soup.find_all('a')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A tip to only download the files from June is to check data in the name of the file. For instance, to donwload the 17/06/2017 file, please see if the link ends with *\"turnstile_170610.txt\"*. If you forget to do this, you will download all files from that page. In order to do this, you can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if '1706' in link.get('href'):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final tip is to use the command bellow to download the txt file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "urllib.urlretrieve(link_do_arquivo, filename)\n",
    "```\n",
